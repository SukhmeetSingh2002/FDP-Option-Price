# Financial Data Analysis and Option Pricing

This project is done for the course MA628: Financial Derivative Pricing at the IIT Ropar under the supervision of Dr. Arun Kumar.

In this project, I performed option pricing of _CRSP_ equity using standard pricing models such as _Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR)_, _Monte-Carlo_ Simulation, and the _Black-Scholes-Merton_ Pricing Model.

## Overview

- **Preliminary Analysis**: Analyzed daily equity data, including plotting prices and log-returns, and performing statistical tests for normality and independence.
- **Option Pricing**: Calculated ITM European call and put options for maturity on May 31, 2024, and compared prices using different models.
